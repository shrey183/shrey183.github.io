I am a master's student in mathematics at ETH Zürich. My primary research interest lies in Analysis and PDEs. I am currently studying stability of functional inequalities under [Prof. Figalli](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~afigalli/) and Black Hole gluing construction under [Prof. Hintz](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~hintzp/).

Before coming to Zürich, I did my undegraduate degree at École Polytechnique in Math and Computer Science. For my undegraduate thesis, I worked under [Prof. Martel](https://www.polytechnique.edu/elearning/en/yvan-martel) and [Prof. Yuan](https://sites.google.com/view/xuyuanpde) on showing the existence of Solitary wave solutions for the nonlinear Klein Gordon equation with log distance.
