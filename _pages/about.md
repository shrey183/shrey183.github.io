I am a math graduate student at MIT advised by Prof. Tobias Colding. My research interests include Geometric Analysis, PDEs, and Optimal Transport. 

Before coming to MIT, I did my master's at ETH Zürich where I was advised by Prof. Alessio Figalli, and undergrad at École Polytechnique where I was advised by Prof. Yvan Martel.
